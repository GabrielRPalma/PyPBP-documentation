**PyPBP** is a Python library for researchers 
interested in studying time series outbreaks. 
It contains the required functions to implement the proposed
Pattern Based Prediction method, which is a combination of
Machine learning and statistical techniques focus on predicting
outbreaks. In our paper "Pattern-Based Prediction of Population Outbreaks", 
we presented the method in the context of insect outbreaks.
